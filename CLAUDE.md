# Service Business Dashboard POC Plan

## POC Goals
- **Validate core value proposition** with real cleaning companies
- **Demonstrate extensibility** to landscape/other service industries  
- **Build modular integration system** for easy expansion
- **Timeline**: 4-6 weeks to working demo

## Phase 1: Minimal Viable Dashboard (Week 1-2)
1. **Basic Multi-Tenant Setup**
   - React frontend + Node.js backend with TypeScript
   - Simple tenant routing (company.localhost:3000 for dev)
   - PostgreSQL with basic tenant isolation
   - Simple authentication (email/password)

2. **Core Dashboard Framework**
   - Responsive layout with configurable widgets
   - Basic KPI cards (revenue, customers, jobs)
   - Simple data visualization (charts for trends)
   - Service industry agnostic data models

## Phase 2: Key Integrations (Week 3-4)
3. **QuickBooks Integration** (Primary Revenue Data)
   - OAuth setup for financial data access
   - Pull invoices, payments, customer data
   - Financial dashboard widgets

4. **Manual Data Import** (Immediate Value)
   - CSV upload for any service data
   - PDF report upload with basic parsing
   - Manual data entry forms for missing integrations

## Phase 3: POC Polish (Week 5-6)
5. **Industry Flexibility**
   - Configurable business types (cleaning, landscaping, HVAC, etc.)
   - Industry-specific KPI templates
   - Customizable service categories and metrics

6. **Demo-Ready Features**
   - Sample data for multiple industry types
   - Basic reporting and export
   - Simple onboarding flow

## Extensible Architecture Design
- **Plugin-based integration system** for easy new service additions
- **Configurable data schemas** per industry type
- **Modular widget system** for custom dashboards
- **Generic API patterns** that work across service industries

## Key POC Differentiators
- **Industry agnostic** from day one
- **Fast setup** (under 30 minutes)
- **Immediate value** through manual imports + QuickBooks
- **Clear expansion path** for more integrations

## Success Metrics for POC
- 3-5 cleaning companies willing to test
- 1-2 landscape companies showing interest
- Users can see their key business metrics in under 30 minutes
- Clear feedback on which additional integrations are most valuable

## Future Multi-Tenant Evolution Path
This POC foundation supports easy expansion to full multi-tenant SaaS:
- Database models designed with tenant context from start
- Modular architecture supports adding new industries/integrations
- Authentication foundation scales to tenant-specific OAuth
- API patterns built for multi-tenant scaling

This POC focuses on proving the concept while building the right foundation for rapid expansion to other service industries and integrations.
